### Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)

We use Google Analytics software (Universal Analytics) to collect information about how you use GOV.UK. We do this to help make sure the site is meeting the needs of its users and to help us make improvements, for example [improving site search](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/26/new-tool-to-see-trending-searches/).

Google Analytics stores information about:

* the pages you visit on Digital Land
* how long you spend on each Digital Land page
* how you got to the site
* what you click on while you’re visiting the site

We do not collect or store your personal information (for example your name or address) so this information can’t be used to identify who you are.
